# Appointment-Booking-System
It's a software solution used by attendant to book patient's appointment instead of maintaining paper-based databases.

The basic idea behind the project is, it lets attendant book patient's appointment for a particular doctor visiting hospital and backend does the necessary checking for slots and making entries in database.

This Project is made using Java, more specifically, Swing, JDBC and MySQL.

## How the project works ?

Consider each doctor can treat a maximum of 5 people per day at a particular hospital.

1. Select required medical field.
