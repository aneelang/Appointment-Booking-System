# Appointment-Booking-System
It's a software solution used by attendant to book patient's appointment instead of maintaining paper-based databases.

The basic idea behind the project is, it lets attendant book patient's appointment for a particular doctor visiting hospital and backend does the necessary checking for slots and making entries in database.

This Project is made using Java, more specifically, Swing, JDBC and MySQL.

## How the project works ?

Consider each doctor can treat a maximum of 5 people per day at a particular hospital.

1. Select required medical field.

2. After selecting required field, say Cardiology, select the required doctor.

3. After selecting the required doctor, the backend will check for the availability of slot in that doctorâ€™s table in database. 

4. **Condition** - If the no. of entries of the current date is less than 5 then attendant will enter the required information and appointment will be booked successfully.
